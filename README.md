# practice-2-digikala
I want to a website like digikala.com for some reason incl. learn about how to use languages, frameworks and technologies in a real project. 
In this project i will use HTML, CSS (tailwind), javaScript and typeScript; If I use another language or technology, I will mention it in the future.
